## Project proposal

### Some resources (Will be updated regularly, so stay tuned) 
* [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr6IzOGoMsQ) is a video explaining how to make a contribution (a pull-request) to someone's repository;
* To get inspired, some readings about *Disney Reasearch* work [here](https://www.disneyresearch.com/publication/designing-groundless-body-channel-communication-systems/);

### Step 1
Fork this repository

### Step 2
After forking this repository, you will create a folder `team-name` where you will write a `team-name.md` MARKDOWN file (`team-name` being the name of your team).
Your file must contain the following PRELIMINARY components:
* Members of your team (name, email, github profile);
* Name of your IoT product;
* A description of your IoT product (A problematic you are targeting, your solution, market you are targeting, etc.). **A paragraph of about 200 words should be fine**;
* A preliminary list of components that you think appropriate;
* [Optional] Any document that you find related to your project. These have to be put under a folder `team-name/resources/`;

This first step is very important and require, from you, a little work of research. Try to get inspired by what is done currently in the market (FabLabs, CES 2019, etc.).

### Step 3
You have until Tuesday, January 22nd (23h59) to fill a **pull-request** containing your proposition in this repository.

### Step 4
An approval (or enhancement) will be issued by us.

### Step 5
We will create, for you, a repository in `Efrei-Paris-Sud - IoT` organization page.
We will follow your developments (commits, issues, discussions, etc.) and the more active you are, the more you get good appreciations for your final mark.
